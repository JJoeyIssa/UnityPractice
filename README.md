# UnityPractice

## Testing out what i can do with unity! Learning along the way.

October 
- Adjusted to Unity's layout
- Figured out how to uitalize spritesheets, make animations and attach those to movement scripts
- Getting acustomed to C# script (';' are annoying lol)
- Started to make a simple platform, adjusted tasks to take on a smaller challenge first
- Started making a small mini-game
